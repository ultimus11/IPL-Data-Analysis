Here we analyze 13 years of IPL (Indian Premier League) data.

First we read data then we get mean, mode and median for runs scored per delivery by batsman.

Mean is the average value (the sum of all values divided by number of values). 
In our case runs(score) can not be a fractional so we convert it to integer.

Median is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all values ascending.
Exception: If there are two values at middle then we take average of those two values as median

Mode is the value that appears most frequently.
You can see on last line when we print mode we actually print 0th index of mode as there can be multiple modes. So mode can be single value or list of values.
