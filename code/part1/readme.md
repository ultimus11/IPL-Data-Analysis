Here we analyze 13 years of IPL (Indian Premier League) data.

First we read data then we get mean, mode and median for runs scored per delivery by batsman.

Mean is the average value (the sum of all values divided by number of values). 

Median is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all values ascending.

Mode is the value that appears most frequently.
